# Plant Tracker

This app helps people keep track of the needs of their plants. A user can log in and create plants, naming them and inputting how much water and light the plant needs. A user can edit the plant (does my succulent *really* need lots of sun?) or delete the plant (RIP Figgy, the fig tree).

In addition to plants, users can create, read, update or delete decorations for each plant. A plant can have multiple decorations (a small rock from a hike, a sea shell from Hawaii, a chipped tooth from a mortal enemy, etc).
